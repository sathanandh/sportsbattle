SportsBattle may, in its sole and absolute discretion, require the account holder to execute a separate release of claims similar to the one listed above in this Paragraph as a condition of being awarded any prize or receiving any payout.</p>
      <p>Paid Contests offered on the Site or App are Contests of skill. Each of our Contests are governed by specific rules, as may be modified from time to time, which are set forth in the Contest official rules and are incorporated into these Terms by this reference. Winners are determined by the objective criteria described in the Contest deadline, roster, Rules, scoring, and any other applicable documentation associated with the Contest. From all entries received for each Contest, winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant information and fantasy sports rules to accumulate the most points according to the corresponding scoring rules. The Site, App, and Contests may not be used for any form of illicit gambling.</p>
      <p>Prizes will only be awarded if a Contest is run. We reserve the right to cancel Contests at any time. In the event of a cancellation, all entry fees will be refunded to the customer’s SportsBattle account except as specifically provided in these Terms of Service.</p>
      <p>The players in each Contest who accumulate the most points and comply with eligibility requirements and applicable rules will win prizes as set out in the posted Contest details. After each Contest ends, the tentative winners are announced (generally by the following day) but remain subject to final verification. Winners may be requested to return via email or regular mail an affidavit of eligibility, a publicity agreement and appropriate tax forms by a specified deadline. Failure to comply with this requirement can result in disqualification. Any prize notification returned as undeliverable may result in disqualification and selection of an alternate winner.</p>
      <p>Once winners are selected and prizes are awarded, the scoring results will not be changed regardless of any official adjustments made by the professional leagues, though we reserve the right to make adjustments based on errors or irregularities in the transmission of information to us from our stats provider or in our calculation of results.</p>
      <p>Contest prize payouts will be published with the creation of each new Contest (“Contest Prize Table”).</p>
      <p>Prizes will be awarded as soon as reasonably practicable following the conclusion of each Contest. The prizes available for each Contest are published in the respective Contest Prize Table.</p>
      <p>No substitution or transfer of prize is permitted except at our sole discretion. All prizes are awarded AS IS and WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, express or implied, (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose) by us. If any legal authority challenges the award and/or your receipt of a prize for winning a Contest, SportsBattle reserves the right in its sole discretion to revoke, cancel, suspend, substitute, or modify the award of such prize. In all disputes arising out of the determination of the winner of SportsBattle Contests, SportsBattle Fantasy Inc is the sole judge and its actions are final and binding.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that should we, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine that you did not comply with and or adhere to the Terms of Service, in any way, we may disqualify you from any Contest entered, in which case any prizes awarded to you as a result of said Contest will be immediately forfeited. You agree to cooperate with our efforts to reverse payments.</p>
      <p>All monetary winnings will be deposited directly into your SportsBattle Account. Any amounts that are mistakenly credited as winnings to your Account remain our property and will automatically be transferred from your Account upon confirmation of the error. Any winnings mistakenly credited to your Account that have been withdrawn by you before confirmation of the error will constitute a debt owed by you</p>
      <p>To the extent that we offer 'live' statistics during gameplay, all 'live' statistics and other information provided through the Site or App and related information sources are unofficial. Live sports statistics and their respective components are offered for informational and/or entertainment purposes only and are not used to determine the results of our Contests. While SportsBattle and the third parties used to provide the Services use reasonable efforts to include accurate and up-to-date information, neither SportsBattle nor its third-party providers warrant or make any representations of any kind with respect to the information provided through the Site or App and related information sources. SportsBattle and its third-party providers shall not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness, or availability of any information transmitted or made available via the Site or App and related information sources, and shall not be responsible or liable for any error or omissions in that information.</p>

      <h3>7.    Contest Disqualification and Cancellation</h3>

If you timely cancel an entry, your entry fee will be refunded back into your Account. SportsBattle has no obligation to honor cancellation requests received after the start of a Contest.</p>
      <p>Deposits made on our site will appear on your statement as SportsBattle Fantasy Inc. All payments are final. No refunds will be issued. In the event of a dispute regarding the identity of the person submitting an entry, the entry will be deemed submitted by the person in whose name the account was registered.</p>
      <h4>Disqualification and Cancellation by SportsBattle</h4>
      <p>Participation in each Contest must be made only as specified in the Terms of Service. Failure to comply with these Terms of Service will result in disqualification and, if applicable, prize forfeiture.</p>
      <p>SportsBattle, in its sole discretion, may disqualify you from a Contest or the entire Service, refuse to award fantasy points or prizes and require the return of any prizes, or suspend, limit, or terminate your account if you engage in conduct SportsBattle deems, in its sole discretion, to be improper, unfair, fraudulent or otherwise adverse to the operation of the Service or in any way detrimental to other users. Improper conduct includes, but is not limited to: falsifying personal information, including payment information, required to use the Service or claim a prize; violating eligible payment method terms, including the terms of any cash rewards payment card, violating any of these rules, accumulating points or prizes through unauthorized methods such as unauthorized scripts or other automated means; tampering with the administration of the Service or trying to in any way tamper with the computer programs associated with the Service; obtaining other entrants’ information and spamming other entrants; and abusing the Service in any way; or otherwise violating these Terms of Service. You acknowledge that the forfeiture and/or return of any prize shall in no way prevent SportsBattle from informing the relevant authorities, and/or pursuing criminal or civil proceedings in connection with such conduct.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel or suspend any Contest (or any portion thereof) for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to, the safeguarding of the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper operation of the Contest (or any portion thereof). This section specifically includes when a Contest Prize Table has been tampered with. We may provide you with notification of such cancellations or suspensions, but will not be obliged to do so. In the event that a Contest is cancelled altogether, no Contest entry fee will be payable by you and any amounts that were to be used for the purpose of entering the Contest will once again be made available to you via your account.</p>

      <h3>8.    Deposits and Withdrawals</h3>

      <p>Creating a SportsBattle account is free. However, there are associated fees for certain Contests and Account types. When you use a service that has a fee you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged.</p>
      <p>To pay for such services, you must provide SportsBattle with the information necessary to process such order including, but not limited to, your billing address and payment method. You agree to pay SportsBattle the charges incurred in accordance with these Terms and applicable pay services.  If you dispute any charges, you must inform SportsBattle in writing within thirty (30) days of being billed by SportsBattle.  If our fees ever change, the changes to fees are effective after we provide you with notice by posting the changes on the Services or by email.</p>
      <h4>Deposits</h4>
      <p>To participate in Paid Contests, you will be required to deposit funds into your Account by any of the methods permitted on the Services. Such funds will be deposited into your Account upon actual receipt of the funds by SportsBattle. Minimum and maximum limits may be applied to deposits into your Account, depending upon your history with the Services, the method of deposit, state-imposed deposit limits, and other factors as determined solely by SportsBattle. We are not a bank and funds are not insured by any governmental agency. No interest is payable on amounts on deposit in your Account. All payments into your Account must be from a payment source on which you are the named account holder. It shall be a violation of these Terms for you to submit payment using any payment method that you are not the named account holder. In addition, to be eligible to deposit money into your Account and play in Contests that award prizes, you must not be subject to backup withholding tax from the IRS.</p>
      <p>If any deposit is charged back any winnings generated from SportsBattle Contests shall be invalidated, forfeited and deducted from your Account balance. In addition, the amount of the initial deposit will be invalidated, forfeited and deducted from the Account balance. SportsBattle reserves the right to close your account – without notice – should a deposit be charged back.</p>
      <p>By depositing funds or entering paid Contests, you agree to provide us with information we may reasonably require in order to run appropriate identity checks and comply with applicable rules and regulations. If necessary, you may be required to provide appropriate documentation that allows us to verify you. While your account is pending verification, you may be able to deposit funds into your account and participate in Contests, but you will not be able to withdraw any funds from your account until verification is complete. If we are unable to verify you, we reserve the right to suspend your account and withhold any funds until such time as we have been able to successfully verify you.</p>
      <p>We also may conduct checks for Terms compliance, including anti-fraud checks on playing patterns and deposits prior to processing a withdrawal, and we may request additional information before permitting a withdrawal. If SportsBattle requests that an entrant completes and executes such an affidavit and the entrant fails to do so within ten (10) days, or SportsBattle otherwise determines that the entrant does not meet the eligibility requirements or is not in compliance with these Terms, SportsBattle reserves the right to terminate the entrant’s account and withhold or revoke the awarding of any prizes associated with such account. In such a situation, SportsBattle may pay out any withheld or revoked prizes to the other entrants in the relevant Contest in a manner consistent with the Rules of the Contest.</p>
      <h4>Bonuses and Promotions</h4>
      <p>From time to time, SportsBattle may provide you with promotional discounts or bonuses – for example, as an incentive to use SportsBattle’s Services, to establish a SportsBattle account or to refer others to sign up with SportsBattle. Such promotional programs will be governed by their own terms and conditions which will be presented at the time of such promotions. Unless otherwise provided, promotional discounts are non-transferrable.</p>
      <h4>Withdrawals</h4>
      <p>You may request a withdrawal of funds from your available cash balance in your Account at any time. The minimum withdrawal is $10 U.S. dollars. Account holders with pending deposits must wait until those funds clear before requesting a withdrawal. Withdrawals shall only be provided via a check payable to you, or an ACH bank transfer to your account or PayPal. SportsBattle does not permit withdrawals to a bank card or credit card.</p>
      <p>Entrants may withdraw their cash prize awards as well as cash deposits by using the "Withdrawal" option on the Site or App. You acknowledge that, in order to complete withdrawals. Entrants may be requested to complete an affidavit of eligibility and a liability/publicity release (unless prohibited by law) and/or appropriate tax forms and forms of identification as reasonably requested by SportsBattle in order to complete the withdrawal of prizes. We also may conduct checks for Terms compliance, including anti-fraud checks on playing patterns and deposits prior to processing a withdrawal, and we may request additional information before permitting a withdrawal. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in disqualification and forfeiture of any prizes. Disqualification or forfeiture of any prizes may also occur if it is determined any such entrant did not comply with these Terms of Service in any manner.</p>
      <p>Once per month, SportsBattle Fantasy Inc. shall reconcile all liabilities owed to users and the sum of funds or credits in the Segregated Account and credits due to SportsBattle Fantasy Inc. from credit card processors as of the end date of the immediately preceding month.</p>
      <p>Processing of requested funds back may take up to five (5) business days; provided, however, SportsBattle reserves the right to freeze your Account and/or delay a request for withdrawal of funds pending completion of any investigation of reported or suspected abuse by a user requesting withdrawal of funds. If you do not receive your withdrawal within five (5) business days, please contact <a href="#"> customer support </a> via in-app support chat. Checks for withdrawal requests are processed within 14 business days, and are sent via U.S. Mail.</p>
      <p>If your Account is closed by us for a violation of the Terms, we reserve the right to determine whether to declare as void any transaction placed by you. If a prize has been awarded on a closed account due to fraud SportsBattle may withhold the prize, provided that the prize is then awarded to another participant in the Contest who would have won the prize had that user not participated. In such an event, we use your Account funds to defray the costs of administration and enforcement of the Terms.</p>
      <h4>U.S. Dollars</h4>
      <p>All deposits and withdrawals will be denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise expressly stated. If you make a deposit that is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, please be aware that the funds will be converted into U.S. dollars by our Payment Processors (defined below) or your financial institution and you may be charged a service fee for such conversion. Please also be aware that our Payment Processors and/or your financial institution may use different conversion rates for deposit and refund transactions. The conversion rate used is not under our control and we recommend that you contact your financial institution directly for more information.</p>
      <h4>Taxation</h4>
      <p>All taxes associated with the receipt of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of any prizes to winners of Contests is challenged by any legal authority, SportsBattle reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether or not to award such prizes.</p>
      <p>Each year all winners who have won $600 or more over the previous year must provide updated address and social security details to SportsBattle. These details will be used to allow SportsBattle to comply with tax regulations and may be shared with appropriate tax authorities. It is the policy of the Site, and in compliance with United States Internal Revenue Service regulations, SportsBattle may be required to submit a Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income (Form 1099) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other appropriate form to any person who wins in excess of $600 (USD) on the Site (winnings less entry fees) in any given year. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, SportsBattle may require you to complete a Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Certification and/or additional tax forms. This information will be used to file the Form 1099 with the IRS.  SportsBattle reserves the right to withhold (from your existing account balance and/or from future net winnings) any amount required to be withheld by law. You remain solely responsible for filing and paying all federal and other taxes in accordance with the laws that apply in your local, state, province, and/or country of residence. SportsBattle does not provide tax advice, nor should any statements in this agreement or on the Service be construed as tax advice.</p>
      <h4>Third-Party Payment Processor</h4>
      <p>SportsBattle uses third-party electronic payment processors and financial institutions ("Payment Processors") to process deposits and/or payments for services or products offered via the Site or App. The information that we provide to and receive from these Payment Processors and the manner in which such information is used and disclosed is described in further detail in the SportsBattle Privacy Policy.

      <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</p>

      <h4>Initial Dispute Resolution</h4>
      <p>It is SportsBattle’s goal that the Services meet your expectations and live up to our promises to you. However, there may be instances when you feel that SportsBattle has not fulfilled its obligations or you may have a different type of problem or dispute that needs special attention. In those instances, SportsBattle is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that satisfies you; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand your issue. Therefore, for any problem or dispute that you may have with SportsBattle, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give SportsBattle an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. In order to initiate this dispute resolution process, you must first send us a written description of your problem or dispute within thirty (30) days of the Services being performed by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@SportsBattleApp.com"> support@SportsBattleApp.com</a></p>
      <p>You then agree to negotiate with SportsBattle in good faith about your problem or dispute for at least sixty (60) days after SportsBattle’s receipt of your written description of it.</p>

      <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
      <p>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p>
      <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, SportsBattle will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, SportsBattle will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>

      <h4>Location</h4>
      <p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.</p>

      <h4>Class Action Waiver</h4>
      <p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND SportsBattle AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>

      <h4>Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</h4>
      <p>Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>

      <h4>30-Day Right to Opt Out</h4>
      <p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to SportsBattle at support@SportsBattleApp.com. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, SportsBattle also will not be bound by them.</p>
      <h4>Changes to this Section</h4>
      <p>SportsBattle will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>
      <p>For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and SportsBattle agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in Fulton County, Georgia. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p>
